## Introduction(Puvee)

## Upload the data( qihan)
```{r}

```
## EDA( qihan)
#- make columns based on each variable like PM2.5,PM 10,NO2
#- time series plot (x is time, Y is each variable,based on city, overall)
#- see if thereis any missing values, if have use interpolation or forward
# taget is either pm2.5 or pm10

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

## Modelling & Results & Evaluation()
## Time series, regression 
## Clustering

## Discussion ()

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
